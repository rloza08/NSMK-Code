Scenario 1

New vlan/subnet is added in existing two summary subnets (upper/lower) in current funnel file in Men&Mice

This will use existing Netx scheme

Below are the high level steps for adding new vlan



Step 1: Safeway updates Men&Mice funnel with new vlan/subnet



Step 2: Create a CLI to produce enhanced Men&Mice funnel

We will have new CLI developed to query the new funnel file from men&mice



This utility will achieve following functions

Reads the following three fields from funnel file provided

·        New Vlan Number

·        Subnet/mask

o   octet1.octet2.octe3 ( This can be 10.x.a or 10.x.b ….up to 10.x.h)

o   octet4

o   mask

Produce new enhanced funnel file that will have necessary information for Meraki config.

·        Vlan Number

·        Subnet

·        Appliance IP

·        Description

·        DNS for DHCP ( we can put either “proxy upstream” or “Safeway DNS IP”)



We will also validate the new vlan has right subnet mask



This CLI will also create the new files required for Meraki API



Step 2: Create new vlan template for automation scripts



Step 3: Update Vlan to existing production stores

We will develop CLI for this function

·        The code will query all networks in org and then read all the vlan’s in each network

·        If new vlan is not in the network then it will create new Vlan.


Scenario 2

In this scenario new summary subnets is added.



We will need to talk this is more details as current Men&Mice funnel does not account for summary subnets

So we will need to know as how code will generate the subnet after it resolves the IP address for  “cc1234”.

Then based on the above we will update the Netx logic.

Once this is done then we will need to make adjustments to Scenario1 logic and we can then use same steps to update Vlan.

We will also have to update code for adding new static route for new summary subnet
