The file is a csv that contains following fields

delete vlans enhancements

a) Upgrade vlans-delete-list to

  {
    "Vlan": 201,
    "Subnet": "10.x.i.0/27",
  }

Logic: if i-z remove static route for vlan, lookup the subnet (i in this case
and look up in the vlans-non-netx for the summary that needs to be deleted.

First make a static route query
that will return:
[
    {
        "id": "1a81fff3-cdb6-4876-9356-f17b27d6b2f1",
        "networkId": "N_686798943174009235",
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "lower summary subnet",
        "subnet": "10.171.88.0/22",
        "gatewayIp": "10.235.91.1",
        "fixedIpAssignments": {},
        "reservedIpRanges": []
    },
    {
        "id": "538c304d-b733-4140-803e-b956572c1d6c",
        "networkId": "N_686798943174009235",
        "enabled": true,
        "name": "upper summary subnet",
        "subnet": "10.235.88.0/22",
        "gatewayIp": "10.235.91.1",
        "fixedIpAssignments": {},
        "reservedIpRanges": []
    }
]

Remove the static route that has exactly the same subnet as returned in the query.
Use the static route id to delete.
